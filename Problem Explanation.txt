The problem requires finding the longest subsequence in an array where the XOR of adjacent integers in the subsequence is non-decreasing. Here's an explanation of the problem:

1. Read the length of the array, 'n', from the input.

2. Read 'n' space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.

3. Initialize a dictionary, 'dp', to keep track of the longest subsequence ending at each element, where the key is the current element and the value is the length of the subsequence.

4. Iterate through each element 'num' in the array.

5. Initialize the length of the subsequence for 'num' as 1.

6. For each previous element 'prev' before 'num' in the array, check if the XOR of 'prev' and 'num' is greater than or equal to 'prev' XOR value. If so, update the length of the subsequence for 'num' by taking the maximum of its current length and the length of the subsequence for 'prev' plus 1.

7. Update the longest subsequence length for 'num' in the 'dp' dictionary.

8. Find the maximum subsequence length in the 'dp' dictionary.

9. Print the maximum subsequence length as the output.

The solution uses dynamic programming to build the longest subsequence incrementally, considering each element and its relationship with the previous elements. By iterating through the array and updating the subsequence lengths based on the XOR property, it finds the longest subsequence length that satisfies the given conditions.
