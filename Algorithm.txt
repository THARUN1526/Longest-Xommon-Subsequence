2. Read 'n' integers from the user and store them in the list 'l'.

3. Initialize an empty list 'xors' to store the XOR values and their corresponding indices.

4. Iterate through each pair of indices (i, j) in the range (0, n) using nested loops. Calculate the XOR value of 'l[i]' and 'l[j]', and append it to 'xors' along with the pair of indices.

5. Sort the 'xors' list in ascending order based on the XOR values.

6. Initialize a list 'upto' of length 'n' with all elements set to 0. This list will keep track of the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each index.

7. Iterate through each entry in the sorted 'xors' list.

8. Retrieve the indices b and c from the current entry in 'xors'.

9. Update the 'upto' list by setting the value at index 'c' to the maximum between its current value and the value at index 'b' plus 1. This ensures that 'upto[c]' stores the length of the longest increasing subsequence that can be formed by adding 'l[c]' to the subsequence ending at 'l[b]'.

10. Print the maximum value in the 'upto' list plus 1, which represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence of XOR values.

The code follows a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem, where it builds the solution incrementally by utilizing previously calculated subproblems. By iterating through all possible pairs of indices and tracking the longest increasing subsequence, it determines the length of the longest increasing subsequence of XOR values.
